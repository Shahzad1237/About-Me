Hello! I'm Shahzad Ahmed, currently pursuing a Ph.D. under the guidance of Dr. Pranay Ranjan at the Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Jodhpur (IITJ). I was honored to receive the esteemed Prime Minister's Research Fellowship (PMRF) in October 2023 to support my doctoral research.
I am currently working on biomolecule detection through electrochemical methods. My interests include electrochemical sensors, food monitoring, conductive polymers, 2D materials, and photodetectors. Moreover, I am exploring applications in food monitoring, where these sensors are pivotal in guaranteeing food safety and quality. My objective in my work is to expand the limits of electrochemical biosensors and maximize their usefulness in practical situations, including healthcare, environmental monitoring, and other areas.
